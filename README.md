这是概率残余位移模型，可作为自复位结构的设计目标，旨在平衡附加SCEDs的RC桥梁的自复位能力和能量耗散能力。结构的静态残余位移是结构的固有特性，仅与峰值位移相关，但是动态残余位移不仅与结构的特性有关，还与地震动的特性有关，这大大增加了其预测难度。概率残余位移模型的核心原理为建立了不同的峰值位移和不懂的静态残余位移下，结构的动态残余位移分布模型，以考虑动态残余位移的离散性和不确定性。具体使用方法见文章：Yang Z, Dong H, Du X, et al.

This is a probabilistic residual displacement model that can be adopted as a design target for self-centering structures, with the aim of balancing the self-centering capacity and energy dissipation capacity of RC bridges equipped with additional SCEDs. The static residual displacement of a structure is an intrinsic structural property and is only related to the peak displacement. In contrast, the dynamic residual displacement depends not only on the structural characteristics but also on the characteristics of the ground motion, which substantially increases the difficulty of prediction. The core idea of the probabilistic residual displacement model is to establish distribution models of structural dynamic residual displacement under different levels of peak displacement and different levels of static residual displacement, so as to account for the dispersion and uncertainty of dynamic residual displacement.
